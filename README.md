# IS640 Python project

This is a Python Django contact management project. You can just download the project. I just wanted to let you know that you need Python installed on your device and Django installed. Use "pip/pip3 install django" to install Django on your device. After installing django, go to the terminal and type/paste "python3 manage.py runserver" command to run the server. Then go to any browser and type/paste http://127.0.0.1:8000/  . Hoorah, contact management is on your device!!!!
